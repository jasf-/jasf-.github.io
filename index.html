title: "About me"
---

I earned an MS in biology from Boston College, where I did research on the molecular minutiae of a yeast that few people care about. Following a brief stint at a biotech company, I fled the real world for academia, doing bench research and teaching at Boston-area institutions including MIT, Brandeis, and Wellesley. I realized that academic librarianship sounded a lot like teaching minus most of the bits I didn't like, and completed the MSLIS program at Syracuse University.

I'm currently the Head of [Research Data Services] (https://library.northeastern.edu/data_services/research-data-services/) at Northeastern University's Snell Library. In this role, I lead a team with expertise in data analysis & manipulation, coding, GIS, and data visualization. I advise on data management tools, standards, documentation, and organizational techniques to support data discoverability, reuse, and preservation. I also assist researchers preparing data management plans for grant applications, and promote potential solutions for storage and preservation of research data upon project completion.
