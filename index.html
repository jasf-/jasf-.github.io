title: "About me"

Jen earned an MS in biology from Boston College, in part by studying the molecular minutiae of a yeast that few people care about. Following a brief stint at a biotech company, she fled the real world for academia, doing bench research and teaching at Boston area institutions including MIT, Brandeis, and Wellesley. Jen decided that librarianship sounded a lot like teaching minus most of the bits she didn't like, so she enrolled in library school, completing the MLIS program at Syracuse University in 2008.

Jen is currently the Head, Research Data Services at Northeastern University's Snell Library. In this role, she consults with faculty, staff and students on approaches to streamline the collection, organization, and findability of research data for current projects, as well as methods to ensure long-term access to research outputs. She also assists researchers preparing data management plans for grant proposals.
